		<!-- description of restaurant -->
		<p>This restaurant is a good place to eat soup dumplings cheap in Brooklyn. The price
		range is from $11 to $30. I also recommend getting the scallion pancake. Its really good too.</p>

		<p> Favorite Dishes: Tempura shrimp, Philadelphia roll, Rainbow Roll</p>
		
		<!-- Description -->
		<p> This is a all you can eat sushi restaurant. Depending on what time you come to the restaurant there will be different
		food. The lunch menu is cheaper therefore I recommend going there at that time. The food quality of course will not
		be the best, but it will make sure you are full. I believe the lunch menu is $15 per person. There are less people than
		the popular Sake's restaurant so I prefer to come to Wasabi Japanese Cuisine instead. The staff there are nice despite
		what the review say on yelp say about the restaurant. My favorite food here is tempura shrimp, philladelphia roll, and rainbow roll.</p>

		<p> Favorite Dishes: Lamb over rice, lamb gyro</p>
		
		<!-- Description -->
		<p> I am not sure if you can count this as a restaurant. Most Halal food cart have really good lamb over rice or chicken over rice. Sometimes I like to get the lamb gyro
		when I have to be mobile. Mostly I just go with the lamb over rice. In my experience different halal carts can have
		different sauces. My local halal cart have spicy, barbecue, and the signature white sauce. The sauce I usually take are
		white sauce and barbecue. One time I did find a green sauce and it was like a mix between hot and white sauce. It was not
		bad.</p>

		<p>Favorite Dishes: Soup dumplings</p>
		
		<!-- Description of restaurant -->
		<p>The soup dumpling in this restaurant is better than Liu's Shanghai restaurant. The soup dumplings in this
		restaurant is plump and full of soup. Biting into the soup dumpling will make you transcend to a place you never
		thought possible. When I go to this restaurant, I mainly just get soup dumpling because it is that good. Becareful 
		when you bite into it though, the soup will be very hot. A tip on eating soup dumpling is biting a little hole on top of the soup
		dumpling and drinking the soup from there. This place is located in Chinatown
		and usually is very crowded.</p>

		<p>Favorite Dishes: BBQ Pork Sandwich
		
		<!-- Description -->
		<p>The sandwich here is really good. The 
		bread is toasty and crispy. The filling inside is soft and fresh. Each bite you take is like going to paradise. 
		The meat is soft and juicy and there are vegetable which balances the meat. Once you are finished with the sandwich,
		you may feel a bit down, but that is okay. It is cheap and I recommend getting their iced coffee and BBQ pork sandwich. The place is located at
		8 avenue 57th street.</p>
