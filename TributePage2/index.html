      <p>Hideo Kojima is born on August 24, 1963 and is the youngest of the three in his family. He first lived in Tokyo, Japan, but moved around constantly. He always knew he wanted a career that dealt with creative expression such as being a writer or an illustrator. However, his family and peers wanted him to find a safer route. Despite being pressured not to pursure being a writer or an illustrator, he sent short stories to magazines, but sadly they never got published. During his college years, he studied economics and spent his free time playing video games. At the time video game was a new and developing sector. By the fourth year of his college career, he announced to his peers that he is going to pursure a video game development career. One his supports was from his mother who was a big influence on his decision. When Kojima reflected on his decision of joining the game industry, he thought it was the right choice because he said that the industry felt like a place where it can give them a second chance. Many of the people working in the industry were in similar situation and thought of games as second chance.</p>
      
      <h3 class="tribute-info-head" id="loneliness">Loneliness</h3>
      <p>Hideo Kojima's journey to being a reknown game developer was a rough one. His early life was accompanied with loneliness. When he was 13, his dad died. Kojima was also a latchey kid, meaning he always had to return to an empty home. He often had to look after himself after coming home from school. The loneliness still affects him as he states in a 2004 interview,"whenever I travel and stay at a hotel I put the TV on as soon as I enter the room, just to deal with the feeling of loneliness".</p>
